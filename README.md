The useMemo Hook Polyfill project offers a custom implementation of React's useMemo hook, which memoizes expensive computations to improve performance. By caching results and only recalculating when dependencies change, this hook helps optimize rendering in React applications. This polyfill makes it possible to use the useMemo functionality in older React versions.
